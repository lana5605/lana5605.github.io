The technology stack involved using Hasura coupled with PostgreSQL to construct the crucial tables for storing data relevant to the leaderboard. The tables, represented here by screenshots from the Hasura console, show the column names and the structure of the data. <br><br> The keystone of this data storage was the user_points_daily_snapshots table, acting as the receptacle for all relevant data concerning the public school leaderboard. This table underwent updates every time a student completed their work in the program. Execution of this action was managed by a consumer: it would receive the completion message off the bus and subsequently write this new information to the table in Hasura. The name of this table reflects its function of providing daily snapshots of points earned by each user, in association with their respective accounts. <br><br> The successful creation of a backend database using Hasura and PostgreSQL was paramount. The user_points_daily_snapshots table functioned as intended, storing and organizing the daily updates of users completing their assigned tasks. The data stored within this table was efficiently used to calculate the total points accrued by specific accounts within a certain time range. The robustness of the database significantly improved the responsiveness and simplicity of our public school leaderboard. <br><br> In this project, I dived deeper into using Hasura and PostgresQL in a real-world application. Being primarily responsible for the creation and mechanisms of the user_points_daily_snapshots table was challenging but proved rewarding. This process enhanced my understanding of database structures, database manipulation, and the practicality of utilizing a consumer to manage data updates. This experience has deepened my knowledge on how to effectively use technology to create efficient databases and streamline data-driven functionalities for applications. </p></div></div><div class="mb-14"><h5 class="text-md font-bold mb-3">Building a frontend app with Rescript and Vite</h5><div class="flex flex-col gap-10 mb-4 items-center"><p class="text-justify"> The task in hand was to build a frontend application that effectively displays the public school leaderboard. Building upon my familiarity with RescriptReact, the requirement was to design a self-contained Rescript app that would then be built utilizing Vite and uploaded to AWS S3. This app would subsequently be referenced through the existing WordPress site. <br><br> Venturing into this project, I acknowledged the necessity to build a Rescript app from scratch. The process comprised of meticulously considering all necessary packages and dependencies required to run the app and their accurate definition within package.json and bsconfig.json files. For giving the app its unique identity, I decided to use tailwindcss for the styling. This initiative called for an understanding of integrating tailwind into a React app, which was a learning in its own. <br><br> The fruit of this labor was a successful creation of a standalone RescriptReact app. This was an app that accurately referenced the tailwindcss output, possessed the ability to perfectly render the leaderboard container, and incorporated the appropriate dependencies as per necessity. It was a paramount accomplishment as the application was built from scratch and embodied unique specifications. <br><br> Despite prior experience with RescriptReact, the task of independently developing an entirely standalone app was uncharted territory. The exercise was a worthy learning adventure that extended my proficiency on creating a React app from the ground up, integrating tailwindcss within it, and ultimately, building a React app using Vite. As a developing software engineer, this newly gained wisdom is invaluable and will undoubtedly prove beneficial throughout my software development career journey. </p><img class="border-4 border-black rounded-xl m-auto" width="1000" src="'+r+'"></div></div><div><h5 class="text-md font-bold mb-3">Deploying an app with Github Actions</h5><div class="flex flex-col gap-10 mb-4 align-center"><p class="text-justify"> Inevitably, the dynamic advancements of technology facilitate a revolution in our teaching and learning episode. To invigorate progress in our school&#39;s teaching approach, an objective to implement a digital model of our school leaderboard emerged. The purpose was to introduce students, parents, and school authorities to an easily accessible and transparent mode of understanding students&#39; academic performance. The task presented unique challenges as it involved the deployment of the public school leaderboard through GitHub actions. The idea was to add the leaderboard to our current Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, subsequently deploying it to S3, so WordPress could reference the files produced. <br><br> My action plan started with understanding how GitHub actions work and how it can be integrated into our current CI/CD pipeline. This involved researching, reading documentation, and learning from other open source projects that utilized this technology. Once familiar with GitHub actions, I added the leaderboard into our existing pipeline by creating a fluid connection between different software elements. This endeavour involved writing scripts for building and deploying the leaderboard. <br><br> The efforts bore fruits as I successfully deployed the leaderboard using Github actions. The leaderboard was added to our CI/CD pipeline resulting in a system that could be built and deployed to S3 automatically. WordPress could reference these files, making the digital leaderboard accessible to the wider public. This even shortened the development lifecycle and improved the iterative process of our ongoing projects. <br><br> The process was a transformative journey of understanding and implementing GitHub Actions. Picking up this new knowledge, I experienced how cloud computing and automation could revolutionize our workflow and products. There were mistakes and obstacles along the way but with every error, a new learning opportunity arose. These encounters reaffirmed the fact that the learning curve in technology is steep, but the benefits reaped post implementation are remarkable. Through this endeavor, I expanded my skills in automation, CI/CD pipelines, cloud storage, and documentation - tools that not only personal growth but also benefited the school system by introducing simplified, transparent structures. </p><img class="border-4 border-black rounded-xl m-auto" width="1000" src="'+d+'"></div></div></div><div class="mb-32"><h3 class="text-lg font-bold pb-2 border-b-2 mb-4">Evidence of My Awareness of Ethical Conduct</h3></div><div class="mb-12"><h3 class="text-lg font-bold pb-2 border-b-2 mb-4">Holistic Experience Artefact Linked to Key Skills</h3><p class="text-justify"> Harboring three years of industry experience as a Junior Software Developer, I have developed a robust technical foundation - a symbiosis between skill and experience that goes beyond a conventional software development role.
