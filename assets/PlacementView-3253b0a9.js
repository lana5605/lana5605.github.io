The technology stack involved using Hasura coupled with PostgreSQL to construct the crucial tables for storing data relevant to the leaderboard. The tables, represented here by screenshots from the Hasura console, show the column names and the structure of the data. <br><br> The key part of this data storage was the <code>user_points_daily_snapshots</code> table, acting as the receptacle for all relevant data concerning the public school leaderboard. This table underwent updates every time a student completed their work in the program. Execution of this action was managed by a consumer: it would receive the completion message off the bus and subsequently write this new information to the table in Hasura. The name of this table reflects its function of providing daily snapshots of points earned by each user, in association with their respective accounts. <br><br> The successful creation of a backend database using Hasura and PostgreSQL was paramount. The <code>user_points_daily_snapshots</code> table functioned as intended, storing and organising the daily updates of users completing work in LiteracyPlanet. The data stored within this table was efficiently used to calculate the total points accrued by specific accounts/schools within a certain time range. This school ranking was stored in a view table called <code>leaderboard_school_participation_points</code>. <br><br> In this project, I dived deeper into using Hasura and PostgresQL. Being primarily responsible for the creation and mechanisms of the tables mentioned above, was challenging, but proved rewarding. This process enhanced my understanding of database structures, database manipulation, and the practicality of utilising a consumer to manage data updates. This experience has deepened my knowledge on how to effectively use technology to create efficient databases and streamline data-driven functionalities for applications. </p><img class="border-4 border-black rounded-xl" width="800" src="'+o+'"><img class="border-4 border-black rounded-xl" width="800" src="'+s+'"></div></div><div class="mb-14"><h5 class="text-md font-bold mb-3">Building a frontend app with Rescript and Vite</h5><div class="flex flex-col gap-10 mb-4 items-center"><p class="text-justify"> The task in hand was to build a frontend application that effectively displays the public school leaderboard. Building upon my familiarity with Rescript, the requirement was to design a self-contained Rescript app that would then be built utilising Vite and uploaded to AWS S3. This app would subsequently be referenced through the existing WordPress site. <br><br> Venturing into this project, I acknowledged the necessity to build a Rescript app from scratch. The process consisted of meticulously considering all necessary packages and dependencies required to run the app and their accurate definition within <code>package.json</code> and <code>bsconfig.json</code> files. I decided to use TailwindCSS for the styling, which called for an understanding of integrating Tailwind into a React app, which was a learning curve. <br><br> The result of this work was a successful creation of a standalone RescriptReact app. This was an app that accurately referenced the TailwindCSS output, possessed the ability to perfectly render the leaderboard container, and incorporated the appropriate dependencies. It was an important accomplishment as the application was built from scratch and embodied unique specifications. <br><br> Despite prior experience with Rescript, the task of independently developing an entirely standalone app was unfamiliar to me. The exercise was a worthy learning experience that extended my proficiency in creating a React app from the ground up, integrating TailwindCSS within it, and ultimately, building a React app using Vite. As a developing software engineer, this newly gained wisdom is invaluable and will undoubtedly prove beneficial throughout my software development career. </p><img class="border-4 border-black rounded-xl m-auto" width="1000" src="'+r+'"></div></div><div><h5 class="text-md font-bold mb-3">Deploying an app with Github Actions</h5><div class="flex flex-col gap-10 mb-4 align-center"><p class="text-justify"> The task presented unique challenges as it involved the deployment of the public school leaderboard through GitHub actions. The idea was to add the leaderboard to our current Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, subsequently deploying it to S3, so WordPress could reference the files produced. <br><br> My action plan started with understanding how GitHub actions work and how it can be integrated into our current CI/CD pipeline. This involved researching, reading documentation, and learning from other open source projects that utilised this technology. Once familiar with GitHub actions, I added the leaderboard into our existing pipeline. <br><br> As a result, I successfully deployed the leaderboard using Github actions. The leaderboard was added to our CI/CD pipeline resulting in a system that could be built and deployed to S3 automatically. WordPress could reference these files, making the digital leaderboard accessible to the wider public. <br><br> Picking up this new knowledge, I experienced how cloud computing and automation could revolutionise a workflow. There were mistakes and obstacles along the way but with every error, a new learning opportunity arose. These encounters reaffirmed the fact that the learning curve in technology is steep, but the benefits were well worth the effort.
