My academic journey has been one of surprising revelations and rewarding transformations. After high school, I enrolled for a Bachelor of Creative and Interactive Media, captivated by the idea of graphic or game design. However, I soon discovered I enjoyed the IT aspect of the degree much more than the design courses. <br><br> My fascination with the computational aspects of my course was further fuelled by an opportunity that came my way—I found myself employed at a software development company, performing basic data entry. It was there that I was immersed in the area of software development as I conducted my work as part of the development team. The combination of my interest in IT and coding courses at University and my immersion in the field at my job led to my decision to transition towards Computer Science. <br><br> While continuing my studies in Computer Science, I was promoted to the position of a Junior Software Developer at the same company, marking a pivotal milestone in my journey. This opportunity allowed me to align theory with practice, mapping classroom knowledge to real-world challenges—a relationship that has rendered invaluable insights and evolved my understanding and skills in software development. <br><br> In the last three years, I&#39;ve grown not just academically, but professionally—taking on substantial projects and responsibilities. One such endeavour during my work placement at LiteracyPlanet had me develop both the frontend and backend of a public school leaderboard, an experience that reaffirmed my passion for software development. <br><br> With a keen eye set on the future, my immediate goal is to secure a role as a Software Developer, ideally focusing on frontend or web development. I am excited to continue expanding my practical knowledge, creating innovative web applications and digital solutions. Ultimately, I visualise myself as a remote frontend software developer, combining my love for software development with the flexibility of remote work. Each step of my unique academic and professional journey has shaped the developer I am today, fueling my ceaseless passion for learning and discovery in the realm of Software Development. </p></div></main>',2);function r(i,s){return n}const m=t(o,[["render",r]]);export{m as default};
