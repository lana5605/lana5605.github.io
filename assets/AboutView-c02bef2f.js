I&#39;m a passionate pianist, musician and software developer. I am based on the Gold Coast where I live with my partner and 3 cats. In my spare time I enjoy playing piano, gardening, gaming, watching anime and playing with my fur babies. <br><br> I am in my final year of a Bachelor of Computer Science at Griffith University, where I have achieved a GPA of 6.3 out of 7 to date. <br><br> I&#39;ve gained 3 years experience as a Junior Software Developer at LiteracyPlanet, where I learned many useful skills for front-end and back-end software development. I began my work at LiteracyPlanet as an intern, doing basic HTML and CSS work. However, after experiencing my attention to detail and solid work ethic, they offered me a paid position as a Data Entry Operator where I entered content for the platform. About a year after this position commenced, I showed interest in software development and switched my degree to Computer Science from Creative and Interactive Media. After learning some basics at university, I was then offered the position of Junior Software Developer at LiteracyPlanet, where I was mentored by the senior software devs and gained valuable knowledge. </p></div><img src="'+l+'" alt="" width="300" class="absolute right-56 top-14 rounded-full border-2 border-white"></div>',3),c=[m],p={__name:"AboutMe",setup(a){return(r,o)=>(e(),t("div",d,c))}},f={class:"min-h-full"},g={__name:"AboutView",setup(a){return(r,o)=>(e(),t("div",f,[i("main",null,[n(p)])]))}};export{g as default};
